# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts flight ticket prices using **supervised machine learning algorithms**.  
The dataset was taken from Kaggle, and the project was implemented in **Google Colab** and later tested in **PyCharm**.  
The main objective is to compare multiple regression models and identify which gives the best performance.
